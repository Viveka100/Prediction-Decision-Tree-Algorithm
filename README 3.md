DATA ANALYTICS



1)Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm :
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to  predict the right class accordingly.

A Decision Tree algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a supervised learning method that makes predictions by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the features, ultimately creating a tree-like structure of decisions. Here's a brief description of how it works:

Data Splitting: The algorithm starts at the root node, where the entire dataset is considered. It selects a feature that best splits the data into two or more subsets. This feature is chosen based on criteria like Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression).

Node Creation: A node is created for each split, representing a decision point based on a feature and a threshold value. Each branch from the node corresponds to a possible outcome of that decision.

Recursive Splitting: The process continues recursively for each subset created by the previous split until one of the stopping conditions is met. These conditions could include a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples per leaf node, or when further splitting doesn't improve the model's performance.

Leaf Nodes: When a stopping condition is met, the final nodes in the tree are called leaf nodes. They contain the predicted class (in classification) or the predicted value (in regression) for the samples that reach them.

Predictions: To make predictions for new data, you follow the decisions in the tree from the root node down to a leaf node. The value or class associated with that leaf node is the prediction.
Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, which makes them valuable for explaining the reasoning behind predictions. However, they can be prone to overfitting if not properly controlled with hyperparameters. Techniques like pruning and using ensembles (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) are often used to improve their performance.

In summary, the Decision Tree algorithm is a versatile tool in machine learning that can be applied to a wide range of problems, from classification to regression, and it creates a tree structure of decisions to make predictions based on the input features.
